I have years of data science and financial engineering experience. I've worked for Ario (SME Banking Platform in Canada), Garanti BBVA Bank, Impera Capital, HSBC. I'm a graduate of  (Master of Data Science) University of British Columbia, (MSc in Economics and Finance) Barcelona Graduate School of Economics, and (BSc Mechanical Engineering) Bogazici University.


I believe the power of numbers if you know how to read them. Without data you are just one more person with an opinion. So, in the big data era, you should be the one who can really understand the meaning of data. I'd like to keep learning and be productive in this field while having a positive impact on society.
